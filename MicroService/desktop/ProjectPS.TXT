The cab file for your application has been built as 'C:\testo\standar_v3\desktop\Package\PrintService.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (C:\testo\standar_v3\desktop\Package\Support\PrintService.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
